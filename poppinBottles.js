// For every two empty bottles, you can get one free (full) bottle of pop
// For every four bottle caps, you can get one free (full) bottle of pop
// Each bottle of pop costs $2 to purchase

// Figure out the algorithm that will calculate this. 
// For example, given a $20 investment, the customer will get 10 bottles of pop. 
// That gives a supply of both bottles and bottle caps that can be used to redeem for further bottles, 
// which will then produce a further supply for recycling.

// Test Output
